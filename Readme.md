**Clip Cloud Prototype**

``What is Clip Cloud``

Clip cloud is an app or extention that I'm trying to make which serves the function of being a version control system for giantic blocks of texts. This can benefit writers, contracts, formating etc. It also has a feature which allows users to have a collective history list of all that has been saved on their clipboard, as well as the ability to favorites some of the listed clipboards.

``How to use Clip Cloud``

As this is only a Prototype, you will simply need the cpp file that has been uploaded to the repository and run the program on your prefered IDE. After running the program, the entire entire face is simple and self explanatory. You'll have the aforementioned features and may use it on your own device and clipboard with however you may please or benefit from. 

``Why use Clip Cloud``

I have not really seem much features like these on apps that I have used before for editing or doing writing work, although this may not be a life changing app, it's certainly a small quality of life improvement if you write alot and do alot of revisions on your work. 

``Future of Clip Cloud Past the Prototype Phase``

This is my very first project or repository that I have accomplished, and I wish to extend this out to be a full functioning downloadable app or a chrome extention. I am but a new and beginner coder, I see my way bringing Clip Cloud to the Javascript frameworks, and to React js as I see it fit for me to produce such a simple app. 

``The limitations of Clip Cloud Prototype``

There is no actual UI other than the terminal of your IDE. I made this prototype without the know almost at all of basic data structure and algorythm, so please excuse the unorganized or ineffecient methodology to achieve the goal of Clip Cloud Prototype. I enjoyed making this and it has helped me learn many concepts through my theory and research as well as practice. I know what Ive learned is but a scratch to the vast coding knowledge base, and I vow to acheieve high enough to make this a career.
